# Gem-Hunter-Game

Gem Hunter Game is a simple console-based game where two players compete to collect gems on a game board while avoiding obstacles.

## Introduction

Gem Hunter Game is a classic two-player game where the objective is to collect as many gems as possible within a limited number of turns. Players must navigate through a grid-based game board, avoiding obstacles and strategically collecting gems to outscore their opponent.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: The game board consists of a grid where players start at opposite corners. Gems are randomly placed on the board, and there are also obstacles that players must navigate around.

2. **Gameplay**: Players take turns moving their characters (denoted by 'P') one step at a time in the directions of up, down, left, or right. Each player can collect gems ('G') when they move onto the same cell as a gem. Obstacles ('O') block player movement and cannot be traversed.

3. **Winning**: The game ends either when one player collects more gems than the other or when the maximum number of turns is reached. The player with the most gems at the end wins. If both players have the same number of gems, it's a tie.
